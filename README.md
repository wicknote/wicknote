This is the WickNote (WIC) cryptocurrency source code repository.

WIC backs WickNote hard currency, issued to provide a stable and reliable alternative to regular fiat currencies.

# summary
WickNote was founded at the beginning of 2018 with the goal of introducing a viable competitor to the fiat currency market. Government-issued currencies suffer deficits such as fraud and counterfeiting. As well, those who use these currencies face the problem of what actual value that bill has. WickNote aims to solve these problems by providing a reliable, crypto-backed physical note that utilizes blockchain technology to verify the existance of the currency being used and to verify transactions to eliminate fraudulent activity.
